## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.org/) - CSS library

### What I learned
I learnt how to use Tailwindcss, I understood that we write HTML in a particular file, and style there also, which I was a little bit worry, and later understood how cool, easier and faster it is.


```html
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
    <p>Improve your front-end</p> <p>skills by building projects</p>
  </h1>
```

### Continued development

I wish I could work with real projects using tailwindcss. I also will continue to read and solve more complex problem using tailwindcss

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes) - Makes me check the short form of style, and what its being used for.
